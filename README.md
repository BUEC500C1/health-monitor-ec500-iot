# SQLite3 Database

## Finished ground work for sqlite3 database CRUD functions
### You can:

- Create a local database called 'database.db'.
- Create required data and alert tables; does not recreate if pre-existing.
- Add (update table) with an item for a specific data type (Oxygen, Pulse, Blood Pressure).
- Add (update table) with up to all three data types at once.
- Get table information, patient information, or one data type from one patient.
- Delete a patient from both tables.

In the main function, there is some testing implementation to review how the functions work.
